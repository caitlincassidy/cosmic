Notes page:

DONE - If there are no notes associated with an event, there should be a message or something indicating that is the case. Otherwise it looks like it’s broken/didn’t load the data.

Can you add a border around the div that contains the notes? And more of a margin between the top of the note and the toggle header?

DONE - Can you add more margin at the very bottom of the page? The Lab 1 toggle header is like right up against the edge of the screen.

DONE - Can you put more margin between the top of the purple save button and the general notes entry?

Can the edit button be highlighted when it’s on hover-over?

And can the notes not be highlighted on hover-over?

Idk if Caitlin is supposed to handle this, but the side bar should be more distinguished

DONE - The ‘Save’ buttons should be consistenly colored. Right now the general notes ‘save’ button is purple while the others are not.

Feedback Page:

DONE - The 'Request Feedback' buttons should be vertically aligned with the toggle header. Also, there should more margin between
the top of the button and toggle header.

DONE - Also, I think there should be a message that says something like "You have not sent out a feedback form for this event."
and then button next to it or something.

DONE - There should be more margin between the toggle headers when they are open  (e.g. the request feedback buttons are right
up against each other)

DONE - I would use less intense colors for the pie chart. Go with pastels.

DONE - Maybe have a confirmation dialog that the feedback form was sent after you click 'Send'?

DONE -Where are the student comments from the feedback form going to be accesible? It would be good to include an example where
it shows those as well. I only see pie chart stuff.
