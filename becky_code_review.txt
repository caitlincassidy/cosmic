If there are no notes associated with an event, there should be a message or something indicating that is the case. Otherwise it looks like it’s broken/didn’t load the data.

Can you add a border around the div that contains the notes? And more of a margin between the top of the note and the toggle header?

Can you add more margin at the very bottom of the page? The Lab 1 toggle header is like right up against the edge of the screen.

Can you put more margin between the top of the purple save button and the general notes entry?

Can the edit button be highlighted when it’s on hover-over?

And can the notes not be highlighted on hover-over?

Idk if Caitlin is supposed to handle this, but the side bar should be more distinguished

The ‘Save’ buttons should be consistenly colored. Right now the general notes ‘save’ button is purple while the others are not.
